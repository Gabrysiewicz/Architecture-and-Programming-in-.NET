# Laboratory 1

## Task 1: FizzBuzz


Using instructions such as loops (`while`, `for`), conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`), and the static methods `Console.Write()` and `Console.WriteLine()`, try to create a program that works as follows:  

The program should display the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) in order.  
- For numbers divisible by 3, it should display the word **"Fizz"**.  
- For numbers divisible by 5, it should display the word **"Buzz"**.  
- For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, it should display **"FizzBuzz"** instead of the number.  


# Task 2-4 Guess Game

Now try to create a program that generates a number, and the task for the user is to guess that number based on hints indicating whether their guess is higher or lower than the generated number.
<hr>
Try adding a mechanism to your game that displays how many attempts the user needed to guess the number and win the game.
<hr>
Add a new class to your project that will serve as a data model for storing information about high scores.  

This class will use **properties**, which are automatically generated methods for getting and setting field values. Properties can perform additional operations beyond simple field access, although this functionality will not be used in this task.
